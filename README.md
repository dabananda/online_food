## Common Issues and Solutions

### Package Installation Problems

If you encounter issues installing packages:

```bash
# Try installing packages one by one
pip install django
pip install psycopg2-binary
pip install python-decouple
pip install [package_name]
```

### Database Connection Issues

If using PostgreSQL or MySQL, ensure:
- The database service is running
- PostgreSQL is properly installed on your system
- Your connection settings in settings.py or .env file are correct
- The specified database exists (you may need to create it first)

```bash
# Example for creating a PostgreSQL database
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres

# Create the database
CREATE DATABASE django_todo_db;

# Exit
\q
```

### Missing Static Files

If static files aren't loading properly:

```bash
# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### File Upload Issues

If you're having issues with file uploads:

1. Check MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL settings
2. Ensure the form has `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
3. Verify that Pillow is installed (`pip install Pillow`)
4. Ensure the upload directory exists and is writable
5. Check file size limits in your Django settings:

```python
# Add to settings.py to increase upload limit
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 5242880  # 5MB
```

## Additional Commands

```bash
# Run tests
python manage.py test

# Create a new Django app
python manage.py startapp [app_name]

# Generate requirements.txt file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generating Requirements File

To create a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python packages installed in your virtual environment:

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This file is essential when sharing your project with others or deploying it to a production server. It allows others to install the exact same package versions you used.

Be sure to include the following essential packages in your requirements.txt:
```
Django==4.2.x  # Or your current version
psycopg2-binary==2.9.x  # For PostgreSQL support
python-decouple==3.8  # For environment variables
Pillow==10.x.x  # For image processing
```

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project:

```bash
deactivate
```
